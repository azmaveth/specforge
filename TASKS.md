## Notes / Issues

### Resolved
- Phoenix generation initially failed due to existing file conflict, manually resolved by user
- ex_mcp temporarily disabled due to compilation issues - needs investigation
- Mox integration issues resolved by removing unnecessary imports in tests
- CLI Owl.IO output formatting fixed for test compatibility

### Active
- Need to implement actual LLM integration (currently using stub responses)
- Consider re-enabling ex_mcp once compilation issues are resolved
- MCP server implementation pending until ex_mcp is stable
